# MERN Boilerplate
I created this app so that you can download the boilerplate code and use it in any MERN application.
## How To Use
I'd just download the repo as a .zip and take what you need. In your project, make sure you have Node, npm, React, Express, Mongodb, Mongoose, CORS and Axios installed.
## How do I run this?
You can run this code by opening a terminal, cd'ing into /api and running 'npm start'. Afterwards, open another terminal, cd into /client and run 'npm start'. If all is well then the react app will pop up and say that the API and the Database are running.
## I can't build from your docker files and/or use docker-compose!
I know, I couldn't get it working right. I'm going to try again from a Linux setup and if I get it running I'll merge the working code into the repo.
